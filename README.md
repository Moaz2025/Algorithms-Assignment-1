## Algorithms to compute the median

- The randomized divide-and-conquer approach.

- The deterministic linear-time selection algorithm using median-of-medians.

- The naive method using sorting and returning the k-th smallest number.

## Computational geometry algorithm

Given a set of two-dimensional points, the goal is to compute the maximum side length
of the square that can be drawn around each point, such that no two squares intersect,
except at the sides.

- Each point will be at the center of the square around it.
- The sides of the squares can only be horizontal and vertical.
